# About Me

Welcome to my website! My name is **ymqu**, and I'm a computer science  undergraduate in china. I am good at backend-develop and I'm passionate about big data , ml -sys, distributed tech , backend-architecture,etc.

I created this website to share my knowledge, projects, and experiences with others who share similar interests. Whether you're here to learn more about me or just exploring, I hope you find something useful and inspiring.

## My Background

I have 3 years of experience in  backend develop and is looking for a new intership opportunity.

 Some of my done and doing projects include:

- [lighty-gateway]:a lighter gateway than some mature microsevice gateway .
- [ez-rpc]:a simple but comprehensive RPC framework.  .
- [nosqlDB]: just like leveldb but distributed (doing!!!)

## Get In Touch

If you’d like to connect or have any questions, feel free to reach out via ymqu823@gmail.com. I’d love to hear from you!

Thank you for visiting my website!
